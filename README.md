### Why Deep Learning
If you want to break into AI, Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought after skills to give you a deep dive here. The foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects is a must and sought after skills. Also Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more is a deep learning toolbox. AI is transforming multiple industries. These are essentials to understand how to apply it, and build a career in AI.
